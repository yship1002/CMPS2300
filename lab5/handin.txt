(1)How many virtual pages can a virtual address space in this system have? How large is each page? Express your answer in KB, MB, or GB, whichever is most appropriate. 

2^20 virtual pages
Each page is 268.4354MB(2^28) large

(2) How many physical frames does this computer have in physical memory?
2^34/2^28=2^6


(3) Write a detailed explanation for how the system establishes the corresponding physical location. Include the values for the VPN and OFFSET for this virtual address (express in hexadecimal).

0x00002012D687=10 0000 0001 0010 1101 0110 1000 0111

We know right 28bits are Offset which is 0000 0001 0010 1101 0110 1000 0111=12D687(base 16)
And left 20 bits are VPN which is 10=2(base 16)
System will find page number 2 and find the offset of 12D687 and concatenate them to find the physcial address.

(4)
0xB9A9
0x49A9

0x0532
0x7532

0x6421
0x8421

0x1B80
0xBB80

0xF300
0x2300

(5) Using the above addresses as a guide, provide an example of a virtual address (in hexadecimal) that results in a segmentation fault.
0x4421


(6) How should page-table size change as the address space grows?

Page table size increases

(7) As the page size grows?

Page table size decreases

(8) Why shouldn’t we just use really big pages in general?

because if we allocate large page many of memory in that page will be wasted

(9)Given an address space with 1KB pages, for each of the virtual addresses 0x00003a39 and 0x00001986, what is the VPN and OFFSET? Express your answers in binary.

VPN is left 10 digits and offset is right 6 digits

0x00003a39=0011101000111001
VPN=0011101000 Offset=111001

0x00001986=0001100110000110
VPN=0001100110 Offset=000110

(10)What happens as you increase the percentage of pages that are allocated in each address space?

As the percentage of the pages that are allocated in each address space increase, the free space will decreases.

(11) Can you find the limits of where the program doesn’t work anymore? For example, what happens if the address-space size is bigger than physical memory?

You can't pass negative parameters into this program. If the address-space size is bigger than physical memory, the program will print error message.
